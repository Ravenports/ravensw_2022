Future package management tool for Ravenports

This is the continuation of the project to create a package management
tool for Ravenports implemented primarily in Ada.

It uses FreeBSD's pkg tool as a template.  The commands and arguments
will be similar if not exactly the same as the FreeBSD tool.  The
work originated at https://github.com/Ravenports/ravensw/tree/master/ravensw2
but its being moved to its own repository for clarity.
